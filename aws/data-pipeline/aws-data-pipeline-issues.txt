-DynamoDB table name is case sensitive.
-Partition key is also case sensitive
-The upload file in s3 should be in a directory. Point the directory not the file from data pipeline configuration.
-Make sure your s3 file in proper format.
-Once the pipeline is active the EMR instances take time. Check in EMR cluster. 
-Do not forget to delete the pipeline and ensure EMR cluster is also terminated after you complete testing. Otherwise, it will continue charging.
